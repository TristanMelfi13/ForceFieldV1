//Task #1 for MelfiFF Dev... Learn Harmonic oscillation mathematics... They seem to be at the basis of MM models
//Because apparently molecules move like that and that's so perfect because this math seems pretty well-defined
//Do coding train... Use P5 because visual understanding... Yea! Work in 1D space for now understand the math, then include real units good luck :) you got this babe
